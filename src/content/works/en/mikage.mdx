At the digi-con hackathon, our team of [@tra_sta](https://twitter.com/tra_sta) [@_SSlime](https://twitter.com/_SSlime) [@ras0q](https://twitter.com/ras0q) [@kamij_i](https://twitter.com/kamij_i) [@toshi00_p](https://twitter.com/toshi00_p) came up with an application called Mikage.
Mikage is an application designed around the theme of "something that helps with gathering reference materials for manga creation." It converts photos/videos taken from various angles of an object into a 3D model using a technology called [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), allowing users to view the results.
