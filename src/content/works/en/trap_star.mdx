This is an app I created during a spring hackathon, which was the first hackathon I participated in after joining traP.
You can place objects on your own "star" to create an original "star" and share it with others.

I was responsible for the backend development and frontend animations. For more details, please check out the [traP blog](https://trap.jp/post/1094/) 👀
