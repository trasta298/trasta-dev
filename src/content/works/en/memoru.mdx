This is a product we created at [Miyagi Hackathon 2023](https://2023.hackathon.miyagi.jp/).
Users can create their own personal room within the app and decorate it with items collected during their travels.

Although we didn't win a prize, we gained valuable insights about how to approach short-term hackathons.
