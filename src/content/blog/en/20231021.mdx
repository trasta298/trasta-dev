I've redesigned this website.

## Why I Decided to Redesign

This site was originally something I quickly put together during my freshman year, and it had various issues like updates being too much of a hassle so I rarely updated it.
So I rebuilt it to allow easy updates by writing in markdown. Hopefully this lowers the barrier to updating (though I'm not saying I'll actually update it).

## How I Built It

For the reasons above, I wanted to be able to use mdx, and I also wanted to try out the View Transitions API that apparently became available recently to make things go swoosh, so I decided to use Astro.
As for using Bun and Panda CSS, it's my philosophy to use new tech when building this kind of site to keep up with the latest developments.

## Future Plans

I might write blog posts here, or I might not. But I do want to start outputting more on the company side.
